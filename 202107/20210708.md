1.1 路由器AC,AP 分别是指什么？

AP 是无线接入点(Wireless AccessPoint)，负责释放无线信号，转发无线数据的作用。

> In [computer networking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_networking_device), a **wireless access point** (**WAP**), or more generally just **access point** (**AP**), is a [networking hardware](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Networking_hardware) device that allows other [Wi-Fi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wi-Fi) devices to connect to a wired network. As a standalone device, the AP may have a wired connection to a [router](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Router_(computing)), but, in a [wireless router](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wireless_router), it can also be an integral component of the router itself. An AP is differentiated from a [hotspot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hotspot_(Wi-Fi)) which is a physical location where Wi-Fi access is available.
