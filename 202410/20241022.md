### 2.doc description

> - SEMAPHORES
>
>   This section reports threads waiting for a semaphore and statistics on how many times threads have needed a spin or a wait on a mutex or a rw-lock semaphore. A large number of threads waiting for semaphores may be a result of disk I/O, or contention problems inside `InnoDB`. Contention can be due to heavy parallelism of queries or problems in operating system thread scheduling. Setting the [`innodb_thread_concurrency`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/innodb-parameters.html#sysvar_innodb_thread_concurrency) system variable smaller than the default value might help in such situations. The `Spin rounds per wait` line shows the number of spinlock rounds per OS wait for a mutex.
