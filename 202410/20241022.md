### 2.doc description

> - SEMAPHORES
>
>   This section reports threads waiting for a semaphore and statistics on how many times threads have needed a spin or a wait on a mutex or a rw-lock semaphore. A large number of threads waiting for semaphores may be a result of disk I/O, or contention problems inside `InnoDB`. Contention can be due to heavy parallelism of queries or problems in operating system thread scheduling. Setting the [`innodb_thread_concurrency`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/innodb-parameters.html#sysvar_innodb_thread_concurrency) system variable smaller than the default value might help in such situations. The `Spin rounds per wait` line shows the number of spinlock rounds per OS wait for a mutex.

## 4.Modified db pages.



Modified db pages 是 buffer pool 中的其中一项指标

`InnoDB` Standard Monitor output, which can be accessed using [`SHOW ENGINE INNODB STATUS`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/innodb-standard-monitor.html), provides metrics regarding operation of the buffer pool. Buffer pool metrics are located in the `BUFFER POOL AND MEMORY` section of `InnoDB` Standard Monitor output:

```sql
----------------------
BUFFER POOL AND MEMORY
----------------------
Total large memory allocated 2198863872
Dictionary memory allocated 776332
Buffer pool size   131072

Database pages     5720
Old database pages 2071
Modified db pages  910
Pending reads 0
Pending writes: LRU 0, flush list 0, single page 0
Pages made young 4, not young 0
0.10 youngs/s, 0.00 non-youngs/s
Pages read 197, created 5523, written 5060
0.00 reads/s, 190.89 creates/s, 244.94 writes/s
Buffer pool hit rate 1000 / 1000, young-making rate 0 / 1000 not
0 / 1000

```



The following table describes buffer pool metrics reported by the `InnoDB` Standard Monitor.

***\*Notes\****:

- The `youngs/s` metric is applicable only to old pages. It is based on the number of page accesses. There can be multiple accesses for a given page, all of which are counted. If you see very low `youngs/s` values when there are no large scans occurring, consider reducing the delay time or increasing the percentage of the buffer pool used for the old sublist. Increasing the percentage makes the old sublist larger so that it takes longer for pages in that sublist to move to the tail, which increases the likelihood that those pages are accessed again and made young. See [Section 17.8.3.3, “Making the Buffer Pool Scan Resistant”](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/innodb-performance-midpoint_insertion.html).
- The `non-youngs/s` metric is applicable only to old pages. It is based on the number of page accesses. There can be multiple accesses for a given page, all of which are counted. If you do not see a higher `non-youngs/s` value when performing large table scans (and a higher `youngs/s` value), increase the delay value. See [Section 17.8.3.3, “Making the Buffer Pool Scan Resistant”](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/innodb-performance-midpoint_insertion.html).
- The `young-making` rate accounts for all buffer pool page accesses, not just accesses for pages in the old sublist. The `young-making` rate and `not` rate do not normally add up to the overall buffer pool hit rate. Page hits in the old sublist cause pages to move to the new sublist, but page hits in the new sublist cause pages to move to the head of the list only if they are a certain distance from the head.
- `not (young-making rate)` is the average hit rate at which page accesses have not resulted in making pages young due to the delay defined by [`innodb_old_blocks_time`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/innodb-parameters.html#sysvar_innodb_old_blocks_time) not being met, or due to page hits in the new sublist that did not result in pages being moved to the head. This rate accounts for all buffer pool page accesses, not just accesses for pages in the old sublist.

Buffer pool [server status variables](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/server-status-variables.html) and the [`INNODB_BUFFER_POOL_STATS`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/information-schema-innodb-buffer-pool-stats-table.html) table provide many of the same buffer pool metrics found in `InnoDB` Standard Monitor output. For more information, see [Example 17.10, “Querying the INNODB_BUFFER_POOL_STATS Table”](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/innodb-information-schema-buffer-pool-tables.html#innodb-information-schema-buffer-pool-stats-example).
